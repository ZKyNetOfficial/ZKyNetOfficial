                        These Terms are governed by the laws of Canada and the Province of Ontario, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or provincial courts located in Ontario, Canada.

                        Before initiating legal proceedings, we encourage you to contact us directly to resolve any disputes. If informal resolution is unsuccessful, disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration under the rules of the ADR Institute of Canada.

                        This Terms of Service applies specifically to our current MVP VPN service. When we launch our advanced ZKyNet privacy infrastructure featuring zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized abuse mitigation, separate terms will apply to that service.

                        The future ZKyNet service will offer enhanced privacy protection with zero logging capabilities, as abuse prevention will be handled through cryptographic proofs rather than centralized monitoring.
